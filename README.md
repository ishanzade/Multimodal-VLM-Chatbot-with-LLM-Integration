Title: Multimodal VLM Chatbot with LLM Integration

Description:
This project is a smart AI-powered chatbot built using Python, Streamlit, Ollama LLMs, and Computer Vision. It can understand and respond to multiple types of inputs including text, documents (PDFs), and images.

- For text, it handles general Q&A.
- For documents, it extracts key insights using retrieval techniques.
- For images, it performs object detection and scene understanding.

By combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision, the chatbot delivers dynamic and context-aware conversations, making interactions more natural and informative across different data types.
